We, the members of Proof of Humanity Origin, ordain and establish this constitution for our governance for one main purpose:

> **Promoting and securing a decentralized sybil resistant registry of humans.**

All Proof of Humanity Origin proposals, HIPs, must satisfy the following articles, or are otherwise considered void.

# **1. Proof of Humanity Origin is a Sybil resistant protocol.**

A Sybil attack is defined as when an actor has control of multiple accounts registered on Proof of Humanity Origin. All HIPs which clearly and demonstrably break the ability of the protocol to resist sybil attacks are forbidden.


# **2. Proof of Humanity Origin commits to the principle of equality of access.**

Proof of Humanity Origin is an open, permissionless protocol with equal access for all humans making no distinction of gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, or age.

# **3. Proof of Humanity Origin commits to the principle of 1 person 1 vote.**

All registered humans may vote directly, or through their delegate.


# **4. Proof of Humanity Origin is governed as a constitutional democracy.**

In the interests of a consensus amongst a wide plurality of members bound by constitutional democracy, all governance proposals must pass three phases --- Consensus Check, Constitution Check, and Final Binding.

## a) Consensus Check Phase 

HIPs in the consensus check phase must pass a simple ½ majority of cast votes to pass to the constitution check phase.

## b) Constitution Check Phase

HIPs in the constitutional check phase must pass an optimistic period as a submission to a Kleros Curate list of constitutional HIPs. If accepted, the HIP is considered constitutional and passes to the final binding phase.

## c) Final Binding Phase

In the interests of broad consensus, all HIPs in a binding final phase must pass a vote with a minimum ⅔  voting threshold, and all constitutional amendment HIPs must pass with a minimum ¾ voting threshold.

Any constitutional amendments which pass the final binding phase will reset all final binding and constitution check phase HIPs to restart the constitution check phase with the updated constitution.

## d) In the interests of democratic governance, all HIPs must:

### i) allow sufficient time for participation.

The voting and optimistic periods of all three phases (consensus check, constitution check, final binding) must last no less than 1 week. Each phase for a constitutional HIP must last no less than 1 month.

### ii) be vetoable.

All votes must include the choice ‘make no changes’ as the first option so the HIP is vetoable.


### iii) be logically sound.

### iv) not clearly and demonstrably break the decentralized curation process of the Constitutional Check Phase.

### v) not bribe voters.

### vi) be submitted for constitution check by a Proof of Humanity Origin member

HIPs which fail the constitutional check are considered treason. The submitter and authors of an unconstitutional HIP are prohibited from submitting new HIPs and are prohibited from holding any office (elected or appointed). A simple majority vote of ½ threshold of cast votes may reinstate these abilities.
